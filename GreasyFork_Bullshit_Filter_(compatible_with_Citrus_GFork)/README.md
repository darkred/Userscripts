Hides scripts for popular browser games and social networks as well as scripts that use "foreign" characters in descriptions, when browsing or searching scripts.
i.e. it filters any/all of these 4 categories:
* **Games**: scripts for browser games like Kingdoms of Camelot, Mafia Wars and Ikariam
* **Social Networks**: scripts for general purpose social networking sites like Facebook, studiVZ and VKontakte
* **Non-ASCII**: scripts that use non-English characters in description (accents, umlauts, cyrillic letters, ...)
* **Clutter**: obvious spam, titles like "asdasdasd", description = title, title < 6 characters, "just a test".


It's the same as [GreasyFork Bullshit Filter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/12179-greasyfork-bull-filter,) now compatible with <a href="https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/4336-ts-citrus-gfork">[TS] Citrus GFork</a>.
Per-request [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/forum/discussion/6643/x)
Note: you may comment out #49 and uncomment #50 in order to change position of the filters list
*(the filters list appears either below the GreasyFork logo (one-line), or a bit lower,on top of the results table(multi-lines))*

Thanks a lot to kuehlschrank for making another great script.
